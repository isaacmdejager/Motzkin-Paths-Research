# Motzkin-Paths-Research

The programs in this repository were written and used during a VERUM combinatorics research project in Summer 2019 at Valparaiso Univeristy, Indiana. The topic of the research projects was titled Colored Motzkin Paths of Higher Order. Motzkin paths are simple integer lattice paths with only three step types. The goal of this project was to expand on the types of Motzkin paths by introducing new step types and colors. Then, our team created proper Riordan arrays based off of these new paths which we called Motzkin Triangles. Using the Motzkin Triangles, we could generate sequences which we compared to sequences in other combinatorial objects. Upon finding common sequences, we sought to prove bijections between our new Motzkin paths and whatever combinatorial object the sequences matches with.

These programs allowed our team to quickly create the Motzkin Triangles and sequences.
